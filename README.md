# TXT Table Export Plugin for Boomega

A simple plugin that allows you to export your records to text tables
in [Boomega](https://github.com/DansoftOwner/Boomega).

**Not stable, not finished, not tested.** Still, you are free to try it if you are interested.
Works with `Boomega 0.8.0` (it's possible that later versions don't support it).

You can download the jar archive in the [releases](https://github.com/boomegapp/txt-table-export-plugin/releases/tag/1.0-SNAPSHOT).
It includes the required dependencies also.
